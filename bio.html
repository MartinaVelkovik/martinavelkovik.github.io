        <p>It all started..</p>
        <p><br>I was born on <b>16 May, 2001</b> in Skopje, where I lived for 7 years, but since then I spent my whole childhood in Rosoman.<br> I went to Primary School-"Pere Toshev" and I attended another primary school for music-"Lazo Micev"-Kavadarci. Music has always been one of my greatest passions. I have won 3 singing competitions, you can see the last performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05g4L1J77HE" target="_blank">here!</a> <br><br>
         I discovered another of my passions in Primary School, and that was the love for Math. I was part of every math competition out there.<br><br> The biggest discovery was yet to come, in 7th grade I had the first programming course and it was that moment I realised, I have found my <b>dream job..</b> <br><br> Since then, I oriented myself towards studies that will lead me to FINKI. I was one of the best students in Gymnasium "Dobri Daskalov" in Kavadarci, PMA. <br><b> Now I am a first-year student at FINKI, and I LOVE IT!</b> <br> <br> Other than my "Professional life", the most important part of my life is my family. My biggest suporters are my parents.<br><br> Few things that "scream" Martina are: Iced coffee, huge love for animals, aesteticaly pleasing stuff, 80s music, creativity and a good book. </p>
